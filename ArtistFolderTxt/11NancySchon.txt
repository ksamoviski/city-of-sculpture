NANCY SCHON
Lentil #11
Nancy Schon’s commissioned work found in Boston, MA include Friends of the Public Garden - "Make Way for Ducklings" sculpture, the "Gateway to Beacon Hill", and "Tortoise and Hare” at Copley Square. In 1991, Mrs. Barbara Bush gave Mrs. Raisa Gorbachev a copy of the "Make Way for Ducklings" sculpture placed in Novodevichy Park, Moscow on behalf of 'the children of the U.S.A. to the children of the USSR'. Awards and recognitions include the Governor's Council on Arts and Humanities (MA), Governor's Task Force on Accessibility of the Arts, Honorary Chair - Copley Society, and many others. According to Ms. Schon, "When I first started doing Public Art, I noticed that people from ages 2 to 92 look at sculptures in parks rather casually, and then go on their way. One day, I saw a sculpture of a child with a cat. The child was not noticed, but the cat was patted, hugged, and smiled at. This gave me a profound insight. I decided, from that event, that I wanted my sculpture to be interactive and touched."
