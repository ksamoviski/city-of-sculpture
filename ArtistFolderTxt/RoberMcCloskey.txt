ROBERT MCCLOSKEY
Municipal Building Bas-Relief Sculpture Carvings
Robert McCloskey, a native of Hamilton, Ohio, created the bas-relief images found on the former Hamilton Municipal Building on High Street. After graduating from Hamilton High School in 1932, McCloskey attended Boston's Vesper George Art School and New York's National Academy of Design. McCloskey returned to Hamilton, began drawing and painting everyday things around him, and produced his first children's book, Lentil. McCloskey won the Caldicott Medal twice, in 1958 for Time of Wonder and in 1942 for Make Way for Ducklings. Three of his books have also been honored by the American Library Association as Caldicott Honor Books. Although he spent most of his adult life elsewhere, he is still known as one of Hamilton's favorite sons. In the six stories in Homer Price, McCloskey looks back with humor and affection at his Hamilton childhood.
