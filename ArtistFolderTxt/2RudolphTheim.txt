RUDOLPH F. THEIM
Victory, The Jewel of the Soul (a.k.a. Billy Yank) #2
Rudolph Thiem, born in 1859, studied sculpture making in Berlin, Germany before immigrating to Hamilton in 1887. Thiemâ€™s work at the Estate Stove Company in Hamilton included the art that adorned the nationally recognized Estate stoves. His design for "Victory", a 3,500 pound, 14 foot, bronze statue of a young Civil War soldier, was selected in a national competition in 1906. Details on the statue are so exact that coat buttons on the bronze soldier include the letters USA. Mr. Thiem modeled the soldier's face after his own. The statue is waving his cap victoriously in the air while standing on an exploded shell.
