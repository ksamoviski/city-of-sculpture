JANE DEDECKER
Snapshot #12
Family is the focus of Jane DeDecker's life and art. Childhood innocence is DeDecker's bread and butter theme. A Loveland, Colorado artist, her portfolio typically includes subjects such as a group of kids playing on monkey bars, two boys pushing off on a bike, or a trio of girls huddled under an umbrella. DeDecker's style also leaves room for interpretation. "The finished piece isn't the end," she says. "The sculpture lives beyond me, my studio and the foundry. I want viewers to see themselves and their lives in my sculpture". Jane DeDecker's commissions include "Over There" for President George Bush and the President's Committee for the Handicapped and "Albert Gallatin" for the U.S. National Park Service. She sculpts in monumental as well as miniature scale.
