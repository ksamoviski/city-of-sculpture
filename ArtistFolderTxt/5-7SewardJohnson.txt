SEWARD JOHNSON
Spring #7
First ride #5
In 1968, after a lifetime as a painter, J. Seward Johnson, Jr., turned his talents to the medium of sculpture. Since then, more than 200 of Johnson's life-size cast bronze figures have been featured in private collections in the United States, Canada, Europe and Asia, as well as prominent places in the public realm. Each of his sculptures is entirely bronze. The realism of the textures and details is the hallmark of Johnson's art, achieved with hours of intense labor. Seward Johnson has been developing unique chemistry for the colors of his sculptures for years. His sculptures have been highlighted in Architectural Digest, New Yorker Magazine, The New York Times, The Boston Globe, Life Magazine, and others.
