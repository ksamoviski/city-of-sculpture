JONATHAN HILS
Resurgence #39
From Mr. Hils Website:
Absence and presence are integral to my work. Using chaotic systemization and repetitive actions, my work intertwines substantial aspects of physical complexity that coalesce into works that have a distinct sense of delicacy and order. The relationship between interior and exterior space, permeable and retentive, and varying line/light density are achieved through obsessive fabrication and drawing techniques inspired by nature, science and industry. Associates to manufacturing, fractals, and organic bio-computational forms are evident whether generated by fabricating thousands of small steel components together or rendering digitally drawn vertices patterns. Most of my work alludes to organic abstraction while hinting at a manufacturing or industrial aesthetic often seen in both man-made and natural constructions. Occasionally, works that are more representational in nature and informed by a desire to implicate politics, race, and belief systems into a broader dialogue of systemization and chaos.
