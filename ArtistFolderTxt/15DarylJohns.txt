DARYL JOHNS
Keeper of the Garden #15
Johns grew up in rural Ohio and developed an early interest in making things with his hands. Johns explains, “At age thirteen, I completed my first carving of a pig with a very dull pocketknife and a piece of buckeye. Over the years, I gained experience by endlessly experimenting with many types of wood and subject matter. As an artist, I am largely self-taught.” Carving stone has also been a natural curiosity for him. Using Indiana limestone, his indoor and outdoor sculptures are both large and small-scale, and include personalized commissions. Johns’ subject matter ranges from people and animals to abstract creations and organic garden designs. Sculptures by Johns are in private collections from coast to coast, in addition to three pieces in Wales . His first piece in a public setting has been installed in “The City of Sculpture” – Hamilton , Ohio.
