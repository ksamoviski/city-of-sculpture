BRODIN STUDIOS
The Protector #31
In 1978, Brodin Studios began as a small company founded by two brothers, Neil Brodin, a Minneapolis Police Officer and, artist, Roger Brodin, in the third story of a warehouse, sitting just on the outskirts of downtown Minneapolis.
Brodin Studios, judged by that long record, is dedicated to creating awards and sculptures of exceptional detail and great value to individuals in Law Enforcement, Public Safety and Military.
