MALLORY FELTZ
Complexity #34
Mallory Feltz, a graduating art student at the University of Cincinnati, has donated a cast bronze piece to be the next installation for the City of Sculpture. Originally from Dayton, Feltz moved to Cincinnati to attend UC’s DAAP (Design, Architecture, Art and Planning) program. She is now looking at grad schools and is considering Miami University. Mallory states: “I was always creating art for as long as I can remember. Building, painting, drawing, dancing, anything creative was ‘my cup o’ tea.’ Why sculpture: “Really it’s my love of actively creating something tangible. I feel most comfortable, and yet still challenged, when I am up, running around, building and moving. All I know is that art is an extension of my life and sculpture is an extension of my body.”
