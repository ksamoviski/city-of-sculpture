MILES METZGER
When it rains it Pours #36
Mr. Miles Metzger’s career began in San Miguel de Allende, Mexico, where he studied sculpture. There he learned the Spanish language and received acclamations for his talent. After returning to the United States, Metzger pioneered the mining and use of soapstone upon discovering large deposits of carving quality Steatite in the California Sierra Nevada Mountain range in 1973. Metzger began showing his sculpture at fine art galleries in mid 1974. In 1989, Metzger opened a 7,000 sq. foot studio and showroom in Angels Camp, California. Today Metzger sculpts in stone, bronze, wood, clay, steel, and synthetics. He also contracts the reproduction of his designs through the use of molds and multi-carvers in China, Mexico, and Brazil. He has trained many carvers in past years; some of these craftsmen now have successful careers in sculpture. Metzger’s studio and gallery, located in St. Helena, California, opened in 2000.
