ALFRED TIBOR
The Happy Family, Fort Hamilton Hospital #18
Mr. Alfred Tibor of Columbus was chosen as the artist for a special piece of artwork in honor of the hospital’s 75th anniversary because his design truly matched Fort Hamilton’s premise that everyone at Fort Hamilton, from the physicians to the custodians, is working to provide our families with the best care available, their “dedication and knowledge celebrate life”. Mr. Tibor was born in Konyar, Hungary in 1920. He was subjected to the brutality of the Nazi regime, enslaved by the Germans and eventually taken prisoner by the Russians. Alfred survived the inhumanity he experienced through his strong will and determination. After World War II Alfred returned to Budapest. In 1957, Alfred, his wife and two small children arrived penniless but free in the United States. Eventually, Mr. Tibor came to Columbus, Ohio. In 1974 he began doing sculptures in a variety of materials determined to show man’s humanity through his art.
