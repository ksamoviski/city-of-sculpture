L'DEANE TRUEBLOOD
Hanna #9
Born in Norman Okalahoma, L'Deane Trueblood resides in St. George Utah among the most spectacular redrock country in the southwest. Proud mother and grandmother, she has lived and traveled across the United States as well as in Europe and the Middle East. Her sculptures and paintings are found in public and private collections throughout the United States and internationally. Working mostly with children as subjects, she has created a series of highly sought-after life-size bronzes. The poses are subtle, the motion implied, understated. With just a turn of a shoulder or the graceful gesture of a hand, L'Deane masterfully conveys a dynamism that few modern sculptors can match. Recently, she has also been commissioned to produce several larger-than-life monuments which now stand in prominent public spaces in several states.
