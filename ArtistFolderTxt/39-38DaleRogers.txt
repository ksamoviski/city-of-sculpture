DALE ROGERS
4 People & Guitar #39 -  Big Dog #38
Dale is a full time metal sculptor from Massachusetts. He designs both large-scale sculptures for individual installation with private collectors and temporary public exhibits full of multiple pieces.
His love for art lies in abstract geometrics, and much of his body of work encompasses the clean simple properties of that style. Over the years, he has incorporated iconic and whimsical shapes into my sculptures that allow viewers to connect with my art on an emotional level. His public exhibits feature sculptures that do just this. He strives to create thought-provoking work that is sophisticated, easily recognized, and will serve as a mental postcard.
Stainless Steel and Cor-Ten Steel are the metals he chooses to work with. The Stainless Steel is beautiful and versatile. The surface of it can be done in many different finishes (as you will see in our gallery). The variations add dimension and depth to the different sculptures. The Cor Ten is chosen for its “long life/low maintenance” reputation. It is what cities and the federal government use to make bridges out of. It oxidizes over time and then seals itself. It offers an organic and simple element to the sculptures while the Stainless Steel brings in a little more pizzazz and punch.
