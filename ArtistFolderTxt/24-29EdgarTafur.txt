EDGAR TAFUR
Space Tower #24
Symmes Monument #29
Edgar Tafur, a former Hamilton resident, created "Space Tower" for the Cincinnati Playhouse in the Park. It was purchased by Hamilton physician Dr. Richard Glins in 1980 and installed in the Peter R. Rentschler Park on the west bank of the Great Miami River near the High-Main Street Bridge. The bicentennial Gift to the City of Hamilton from Historic Hamilton, Inc. in 1991 was the restoration of "Symmes Monument", which was completed by Mr. Tafur. Additionally, Tafur was commissioned for a piece at the Lewis Center Chapel in Cincinnati.
