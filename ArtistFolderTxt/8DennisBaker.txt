DENNIS BAKER
Star Formation #8
The City of Sculpture's first artist-in-residence is Dennis C. Baker, who is working at Hamilton Scrap Processors each weekend. Dennis grew up in Northern Indiana and attended Manchester College. He graduated with a degree in biology and biochemistry. During college years, he took classes in art, specifically painting. In 1979, Dennis moved to Cincinnati where he works for a cardiovascular device company, Medtronic, Inc. Now a consultant for them, Dennis spends his time in operating rooms. "I have always enjoyed working with my hands as a stress reliever." Dennis says. " Over the years I constantly tried new things - one of which was welding, which I absolutely fell in love with." Dennis graduated in 1996 from a vocational school's welding class and has taken several advanced courses since on welding, painting, and applying gold leaf & patina's to his artwork. He considers himself to essentially be self-taught and is proud of his development.
