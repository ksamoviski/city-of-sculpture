ANDREA MYKLEBUST & STANTON G. SEARS
Hamilton Gateway Butler County Peace Memorial #16
Peace Officer Memorial #28
Andrea Myklebust and Stanton Gray Sears were the design team chosen to execute a gateway structure and monumental lantern for the new Government Services Center. Completed in summer of 2000, it was at the dedication of "Hamilton Gateway" that Governor Bob Taft signed a proclamation designating Hamilton as the “City of Sculpture”. Other public and civic artwork of Myklebust and Sears include the sculptural seating area for the Florida State Department of Health, a 63-foot sculptural tower for the 25-foot North Hennepin Community College Carillon, and the Minnesota Vietnam Veterans Memorial in St. Paul Minnesota. "It is our strong belief that the best civic artwork forges connections between people and their physical environment."
